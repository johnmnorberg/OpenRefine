# OpenRefine
As a hobby, I enjoy making homebrewed beer. After using OpenRefine at work to parse a poorly designed automated report into tabular form, I thought about parsing a PDF document about beer style guidelines from the Beer Judge Certification Program website (https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php). I was inspired by beer taxonomy charts, such as the one featured in this article: https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-beer-in-one-chart-2015-8. I could have simply copied and pasted all the relevant information I needed, but I opted to practice OpenRefine instead. This project was purely for personal development and use.
